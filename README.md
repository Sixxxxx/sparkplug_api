# sparkplug_api

Hello there

This is an application used for recieving feedback from users. Before you run the app, ensure all dependencies are up to date. 

NOTE: This Application is built on the .net 6 framework.

Swagger has been integrated into the application which can be accessed at this address https://localhost:44321/swagger/index.html and opens up once you run the application but if you want to use postman, you'll need to export the documentation which can be found in the root of the application

There are five endpoints that cover all basic CRUD operations

Happy testing
